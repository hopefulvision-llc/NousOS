- Q2 roadmap defined based on Q1 learnings

## Development Principles

1. **Augmentation Over Replacement**: Technology that enhances human capabilities
2. **Sacred Technology**: Design that serves human flourishing
3. **Consciousness-First**: Systems that support awareness and growth
4. **Physical Connection**: Digital tools that encourage real-world interaction
5. **Transparent Governance**: Open, verifiable political systems

## Resource Allocation

- **Digital Shamanism**: 35% (highest priority for consciousness tech)
- **Technical Infrastructure**: 30% (foundation for all other work)
- **Creative Projects**: 20% (public-facing demonstrations)
- **Political Systems**: 15% (long-term vision development)

## Success Metrics

- Functional prototypes in each division
- Documentation enabling external collaboration
- Public demonstrations generating interest
- Technical foundation for Q2 scaling
- Community beginning to form around HopefulVision vision

## Notes

This Q1 roadmap balances ambitious vision with realistic prototype development. The focus is on creating tangible demonstrations of HopefulVision's consciousness-based technology philosophy while building the infrastructure for future growth.
